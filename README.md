Project name: Snake Game

By: Haley Brdak

welcome to my snake game!
  to begin, press start with your cursor.
  the board will load once the game starts, and the snake begins to move. use your arrow keys to change the direction of the snake
  the objective of the game is to eat as much of the food as possible without dying.
  every 10 food eaten, the snake gains speed up until score 50.
  you die if the snake runs into itself, or a wall.
  you may restart the game if you die.
